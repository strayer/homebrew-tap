  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The watcher needs Accessibility permission for the binary itself:
        System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility > + > #{opt_bin}/dock-badge-counter
      A permission prompt is shown on first start. After a `brew upgrade` the grant must be
      renewed, because the binary's ad-hoc code signature changes.

      Example config: #{pkgetc}/config.toml.example
